                Welcome to the Sunny Acres Corn Maze. We first heard about mazes from agricultural
                exchange students who came from England in 1985. In Europe, mazes are very popular
                in castle gardens. After hearing about the mazes in Europe, we thought it would
                be a great idea to build one of our own right outside of Council Bluffs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since 1997, thousands of people have enjoyed our Corn Mazes. We hope that your family
                gets as much enjoyment out of this year's Corn Maze as we did building it! Our family
                would like to invite your family to come out and visit us at this year's Corn Maze
                and AutumnFest.

                Our new 15-acre maze (with over 4 miles of trails to explore) is filled with twist
                and turns that’s good fun for adults and kids alike! See how adventurous you are
                as you wind through the maze while taking an interactive quiz. Answer the questions
                correctly and receive additional clues to solve the maze. For families with young
                children, our maze is filled with jokes, riddles and quests. Try to be the first
                in your group to punch out your quest card by visiting the secret spots. This maze
                is the perfect size and height for little ones. Resting places and educational displays
                are scattered throughout.</p>
            <p>
                There is no water available in the maze. Make sure you bring water bottles with
                you! No one under the age of 12 will be allowed in the maze without an adult at
                any time.
