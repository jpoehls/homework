            have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning
            of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created
            equal." I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former
            slaves and the sons of former slaveowners will be able to sit down together at a
            table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi,
            a desert state, sweltering with the heat of injustice and oppression, will be transformed
            into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four children will
            one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin
            but by the content of their character. I have a dream today.

            I have a dream that one day the state of Alabama, whose governor's lips are presently
            dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, will be transformed
            into a situation where little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands
            with little white boys and white girls and walk together as sisters and brothers.
            I have a dream today. I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted,
            every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain,
            and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be
            revealed, and all flesh shall see it together. This is our hope. This is the faith
            with which I return to the South. With this faith we will be able to hew out of
            the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform
            the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With
            this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together,
            to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be
            free one day.

            This will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with a new
            meaning, "My country, 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land
            where my fathers died, land of the pilgrim's pride, from every mountainside, let
            freedom ring." And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true. So
            let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire. Let freedom ring
            from the mighty mountains of New York. Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies
            of Pennsylvania! Let freedom ring from the snowcapped Rockies of Colorado! Let freedom
            ring from the curvaceous peaks of California! But not only that; let freedom ring
            from Stone Mountain of Georgia! Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee!
            Let freedom ring from every hill and every molehill of Mississippi. From every mountainside,
            let freedom ring.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we let freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet,
            from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of
            God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics,
            will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, <em>Free
                at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!</em>
