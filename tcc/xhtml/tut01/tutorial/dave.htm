        Who Am I?</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to <b>Dave's Devil Sticks</b>. If you are looking for juggling balls, hacky
        sacks, pins, unicycles, or magic hats, you've come to the wrong place; but if you're
        looking for high-quality, hand-crafted devil and flower sticks, this is the site
        for you. I've been designing and building sticks for the past 20 years, and I know
        that my sticks are the best of their kind. Don't take my word for it; read the following
        testimonial:</p>
    <blockquote>

        <p>
            I'm more than happy to recommend Dave Vinet's products. I came upon his work 10
            years ago and was immediately impressed by his craftsmanship. I've been using his
            sticks in my shows ever since. They're durable, well-balanced, and attractive props
            and are the perfect complement to my performances. Thanks Dave!</p>

        Every set is checked and tested before being shipped out to assure perfect quality.
        I take pride in every one of my sticks and I want my customers to feel that same
        pride.</p>
    <h2>
        My Products</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Basic Stick</b><br />
            The easiest stick to learn with, but "grippy" enough for the most demanding tricks.
            Comes in red, green, and blue. </li>
        <li><b>Flower Stick</b><br />
            A graceful stick with colored tassels. Flower Sticks float more slowly, giving you
            the ideal chance to practice new moves. </li>
        <li><b>Master Stick</b><br />
            My most popular stick is shorter and heavier for fast play and more advanced tricks.
            Each Master set is available in custom colors. </li>
        <li><b>Glow Stick</b><br />
            The Glow Stick shines brightly at night (without the danger of a fire stick). It
            combines the fun and versatility of the Master Stick, adding the fun tricks unique
            to a glow-in-the-dark stick. </li>
